        <h2>Welcome</h2>

        <p>Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site,
             it would be the ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching,
             whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding,
             or an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other like-minded people.</p>
